# WinSnapshot


Utility written in AutoHotKey out of necessity as our 4K workstation/monitor setup would, when locked, resize every window to a tiny square in the top-corner, and stack every window on top of eachother.

This tool takes regular file-saved snapshots during unlocked/normal use, which are then used to put all the windows back when you unlock the workstation again.
